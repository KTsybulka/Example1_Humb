Some days it don't come easy
Some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end

Some nights you're breathing fire
Some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever
Seen before or will again

Maybe I'm crazy, but it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me, no-one else can save me now but you
