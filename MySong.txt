Some days it don't come easy
Some days it don't come hard
Some days it don't come at all
And these are the days that never end

Some nights you're breathing fire
Some nights you're carved in ice
Some nights you're like nothing I've ever
Seen before or will again

Maybe I'm crazy, but it's crazy and it's true
I know you can save me, no-one else can save me now but you

As long as the wheels are turning
As long as the bays are burning
As long as your dreams are coming true
You'd better believe it

I would do anything for love
I know it's true and that's a fact
I would do anything for love
And there'll never be no turning back
But I'll never do it better than I do it with you
So long, so long
And I would do anything for love
Oh, I would do anything for love
I would do anything for love but I won't do that
I won't do that
